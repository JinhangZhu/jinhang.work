Hiya! I am a Robotics postgraduate at the University of Bristol and now doing <span class="mark">object detection</span>. Interesting but hard to get going. Previously, I graduated from Wuhan University and the major was Measuring & Controlling Technology and Instrumentations.

I build this website to post my blogs, some coding coursework assignments, the summaries of crucial knowledge and the MOST IMPORTANTLY, my reviews of object detection. Besides, I also have an archived blog for French learning: [BLOG FRAN√áAIS](https://zhujinhang.wordpress.com/). BTW, you won't miss the chance to chat with me right? Go to any of the posts and comment on it!

| 2020/03/27 | [Research Plan](https://github.com/JinhangZhu/rrp-project) first commit. |
| 2020/01/26 | Dissertation project kick-off.                               |
| 2019/12/08 | I and <a href="https://me.csdn.net/weixin_44536896">Wenxing</a> **finished the coursework** today. All the parts were done purely by writing codes in MATLAB without the usage of Robotics Toolbox. We are now writing the report and we hope it all goes well. |
| 2019/10/31 | Recently, I am doing a group work with <a href="https://me.csdn.net/weixin_44536896">Wenxing</a> on the <strong>kinematics of both serial and parallel robots</strong>. This coursework also includes suggestions of topics I need to work on to demonstrate a fuller understanding of the more advanced parts. The deadline for submission is 13 December 2019. |
