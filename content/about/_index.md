Hiya! I am a Robotics postgraduate at the University of Bristol and now doing object detection. I found it tough but really interesting. Previously, I graduated from Wuhan University and the major was Measuring & Controlling Technology and Instrumentations.

I build this website to post my blogs, some coding coursework assignments, the summaries of crucial knowledge and the MOST IMPORTANTLY, my reviews of object detection. Besides, I also have an archived blog for French learning: [BLOG FRAN√áAIS](https://zhujinhang.wordpress.com/). BTW, you won't miss the chance to chat with me right? Go to any of the posts and comment on it!
